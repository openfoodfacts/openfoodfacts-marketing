# openfoodfacts-marketing

Open Food Facts wants to convey **some messages** (Get the App, Import your products into OFF…) to various **target demographics** (producers, contributors, users…) **using several vectors** (app, website, blog, social media…) **to achieve objectives** (eg: app install, data import) **measured by metrics** (eg: 500 products added, 23 producers convinced, 1234 installs per day…)

We have a lot of potential options, some are more or less effective than others, some messages more convincing than others (and that might depend on the person you're telling this message to), and we might not be able to measure all metrics yet (or make them easily understandble and contextualized)
